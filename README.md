# Simulating CA1 spine head with AD
Stemming from the observation that calcium seems to be upregulated in AD neurons, one of the leading hypotheses for early synaptic loss in neurons is the [‘calcium hypothesis’](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19795132/). FAD mutations have been to seen to affect sensitivity of IP3 receptors which control the ER calcium store ([Cheung 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18579078/)),([Stutzmann 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14724250/)). In this project,a deterministic computational model of an average CA1 dendritic spine head was used to investigate how an increase in open probability of IP3 receptors may disrupt LTP/LTD in the spine.
