Caged IP3 was introduced to the above model. A flash of 10 msec duration would photolyze ~4% of the total caged IP3 (Stutzmann 2004). So a linear term with respect to caged IP3 and coefficient 0.04 was added to the model. Initial caged IP3 was taken as 10uM in accordance with the experiment.
Fluorescent buffer:  50uM fura-2 was used for the experiment. Dissociation and association constants were taken from ([Paredes,2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666335/)). The chemical reaction was modeled as :
<br/>
                                         [Ca] + [Buffer] <  =  =  > [CaBuffer]
